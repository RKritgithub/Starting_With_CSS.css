<!-- /* Question_2: */ -->
<!-- /* Build an HTML page with multiple paragraphs, each assigned a unique class name. Write CSS rules using class selectors to apply distinct styling to each paragraph. Follow the BEM naming convention and
explain how you've named the classes. */
/* Answers: */
 BEM is a popular naming convention for writing clean and maintainable CSS. It divides class names into three parts: 

Block (B): The main container or component.
Element (E): A part or element inside the block.
Modifier (M): A variation or modification of the block or element.
Here's an example of an HTML page following the BEM naming convention:  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>BEM Example</title>
    <style>
        /* B: Block */
        .paragraph {
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }

        /* E: Element */
        .paragraph__header {
            font-weight: bold;
            font-size: 18px;
        }

        .paragraph__content {
            font-size: 14px;
            line-height: 1.5;
        }

        /* M: Modifier */
        .paragraph--important {
            background-color: yellow;
        }

        .paragraph--highlight {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p class="paragraph__header">Block 1</p>
        <p class="paragraph__content">This is the content of Block 1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph paragraph--important">
        <p class="paragraph__header">Block 2 (Important)</p>
        <p class="paragraph__content">This is the important content of Block 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph paragraph--highlight">
        <p class="paragraph__header">Block 3 (Highlighted)</p>
        <p class="paragraph__content">This is the highlighted content of Block 3.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
<!-- /* In this example:

1.Each paragraph is a "Block" and is given the class name "paragraph."
2.Within each block, there are "Element" classes for the header and content, named "paragraph__header" and "paragraph__content," respectively.
3.There are also "Modifier" classes to apply additional styling, such as "paragraph--important" and "paragraph--highlight" for variations of the block.
4.This structure makes it clear which styles are applied to specific elements and variations, making your CSS more maintainable and readable. */ -->
